# Retroarch on Docker
This image has everything you need to run tests involving Retroarch
(for example, when testing homebrew game builds).

This repository contains an example Gitlab CI file that builds a rom
and then tests it on Retroarch by taking a screenshot.

You can also use `xdotool` to emulate key presses.
